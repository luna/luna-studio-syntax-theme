THESE FILES HAVE TO BE TRACKED BY GIT!

The files in this folder are auto generated by this package from its config. Currently, there is no option to tell atom to reload these files after generating them on startup. The auto reload plugin cannot be invoked, because events are not yet enabled and we cannot hack it around. It would be possible to borrow some tricks from dev-auto-reload to accomplish it, but for now it is too much work for to little reward and it would be much more "breakable" with newer atom versions.
